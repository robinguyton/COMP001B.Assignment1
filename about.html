    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="images/Robin_Baby.jpg" alt="Image of Robin with Baby the Cat" height="600" width="800" class="center">
    
<p class="purple">I am Robin Guyton and I am 34 years old. I am a veteran of the US Navy. I currently work as an Aircraft Machinist at Fleet Readiness Center Lemoore in the Machine Shop.</p>

<p class="black">I am an animal lover. My ultimate life's goal is to help as many animals as possible through volunteering at shelters, fostering homeless animals, and donating money to assist shelters with new intakes. If I were a millionaire and were writing a will, I'd probably leave 90% of my money to animal shelters. </p>

<p class="blue">I am a huge Arsenal fan. I am a member of the Arsenal America group, the Fresno Gooners. I have been to several live Arsenal games, bu unfortunately none in England because the one game I actually had a ticket to had gotten canceled!</p>
